# IROS 2020 Mixed Reality and Robotics Tutorial
# Demo 1: Robot Interaction through Mixed Reality

Microsoft is hosting a workshop at the IROS 2020 conference on Mixed Reality and Robotics.
This repository contains all the code required to run, build and deploy Demo 1.
The tutorial is available starting October 25th 2020 until November 25th 2020 at https://www.iros2020.org/.

Demo 1 aims to:
- Highlight how the robotic community can benefit from Mixed Reality
- Show some features of the HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors, and other products, services & tools from the Mixed Reality ecosystem.
- Serve as a playground and starting point for researchers to use Mixed Reality with their own robots

The demo application allows you to command a simulated or real Clearpath Jackal robot and an industrial robot arm attached to it in MR. There are multiple control modes available. This repo also contains Dockerfiles to build and run the Jackal simulation and navigation stack.
